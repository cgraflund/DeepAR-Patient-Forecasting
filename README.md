# DeepAR Patient Forecasting
This project was a part of the Colorado School of Mines Summer 2020 Field Session for Medecipher.

The goal of this project was to experiment and find a forecasting model that had better error metrics than Medecipher's current model, Arimax.

Amazon's machine learning algorithm, DeepAR, was used for this notebook.

For privacy reasons, the patient dataset is not included in this repository.
